Hey Alex! I'm really sorry that I failed to do your critique in a timely fashion and hope it didn't impede your progress
too much.

## Explicit Typing
This seems good, trying to guess what someone is trying to say without forcing them to specify what _kind of thing_
theyre trying to say is going to be really hard (read: probably impossible)

## Logo
I wanna see your logo!

## Suggestions
I think that there are two routes to go with suggestions, but they might play nicely together if you wanted....

1) A kind of tab complete, if you start writing Cir- then you get a suggestion to tab complete to circle, etc.

2) A suggestion engine that suggests types of things you can draw from the very start. As in you open up the GUI and on the
screen it says, "try drawing a circle!" and you could click that and it would draw it for you. And that suggestion could change
"randomly" every time the program is launched. 

2.5) I think if you wanted to intermingle these you could have the tab complete option show up (maybe in a greyish color) on
on the screen ahead of time! that would be pretty slick

happy thanksgiving!
